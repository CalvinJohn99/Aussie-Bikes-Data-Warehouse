# Aussie-Bikes-Data-Warehouse
The project outlines the implementation of a robust data warehouse using Microsoft SSIS based on a case scenario involving Aussie Bikes, its sales system and ER Model. The data was consolidated from multiple operational tables in the sales system to optimize for data driven decision-making. Please peruse the report for a detailed overview of the sales system ER model, ETL steps carried out based on the designed dimensional model, and the results from analytical queries for identifying top customers, products, and sales territories. 

I have attached the data sources, the backup file of the created data warehouse, images of the sales system ER model and the corresponding dimensional model, SQL Queries, stored procedures, screenshots of query outputs, and screenshots of the ETL Transformation steps in SSIS.
